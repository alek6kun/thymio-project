    "The aim of our project is to manage the thymio's path to a target in an environment containing obstacles.\n",
    "Our project uses a camera to create a map of the environment, taking obstacles into account. The thymio plans its path based on this map, and travels to where the obstacle is. If the environment changes and the robot detects an unexpected obstacle, the camera generates a new map that takes the new obstacle into account, and the thymio corrects its route.\n",
    "## Assumptions and environment description\n",
    "- The environment is a plane.\n",
    "- The ground is only one color, not green, not black and not red.\n",
    "- Obstacles color is black\n",
    "- The goal color is green\n",
    "- Operate the camera, obstacles and robot in a controlled environment\n",
    "- The Thymio is identified by two unique pieces of red tape\n",

    "## 2. General program flow <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"General_program_flow\"></a>\n",
    "### The overall program sequence is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot has 4 different states, which are the body of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these states, an image is periodically acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program starts, the robot is in state 0. \n",
    "- State 0\n",
    "    - The program searches for the robot until a path from the robot's position to the target can be calculated and stored in memory. Once this has been done, the robot switches to state 1.\n",
    "- State 1\n",
    "    - The robot follows the previously calculated path. It regularly corrects its trajectory using the Kalmann filter.\n",
    "    - If the robot is kidnapped, it enters state 3.\n",
    "    - If the robot detects an unexpected obstacle, it enters state 4.\n",
    "    - If the robot has reached its goal, it stops.\n",
    "- State 3:\n",
    "    - the robot stops moving, and waits to be put back on the ground. When this is done, it returns to state 0.\n",
    "- State 4:\n",
    "    - the robot moves backwards until it can no longer see an obstacle, then returns to state 0.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Use of asynchronous programming\n",
    "Asynchronous programming was used to send command signals to the motor, to read values from the robot's proximity sensors and to read values from the motor speeds.\n",

    "### 3.1. Robot Detection and Localisation \n",
    "\n",
    "This is conducted throught the `find_robot()` function which operates solely on the defined vision class (as such this is the sole input). It accomplishes this through advanced image processing techniques, focusing on color filtering and contour detection, followed by a detailed analysis of the detected shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, through *colour filitering* the image is converted from its original BGR format to RGB. We then apply a colour filter to isolate the colour red, which is present on the thymio robot (as per our assumptions). This is achieved through definind a specific range in the RBG colour space that corresponds ot the red colour, resulting in a binary mask whre the red areas are highlighted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we undergo *contour detection* by using `cv2.findContours()` to detect the exact shape and structure of the labelling on the thymio. These contours, representing the boundaries of the red shapes are critical for the accurate determination of the robot's position. A specific range of contour areas are checked, to denoise the result and only get the two markers contours and positions. The contour area feature is also used to differentiate between the nose marker and the tail marker on the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows us to *calculate the centroids* by utilising the moments of the two contours. `cv2.moments()` allows for extraction of specific spatial moments required to compute the coordinates of the centroid which are calculated using the following formulae:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_x = \\frac{M_{10}}{M_{00}},\\; C_y = \\frac{M_{01}}{M_{00}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of this centroid helps provide 5 critical pieces of information:\n",
    "1. **Central reference point**: Concise and accurate position of robot in environment, calculated from the average of the two markers position.\n",
    "2. **Orientation of robot**: The direction in which the robot is facing is inferred from the arctangent of the two centroids locations. \n",
    "3. **Scale Calibration**: By knowing the physical distance between the two marker centroids on the robot and comparing it with the pixel distance between their centroids in the image, you can establish a scale factor, providing the scale for all future calculations.\n",
    "4. **Movement Analysis**: The centroid can be tracked in sequential frames, thus, changes in the centroid's location over time provide information about the speed and direction of the robot's movement. \n",
    "5. **Path Planning Input**: The positional data derived from the centroids assist significantly in the path planning process, to be elaborated later in the report. \n",

    "### 3.2. Obstacle Detection\n",
    "This is achieved through the `find_graph()` function which again takes in the vision class as its sole input. Obstacle detection is achieved through Greyscale conversion, thresholding, contour approximation which blends together to contribute to larger objective of creating a map for the robot to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is *Greyscale Conversion* which significantly simplifies the process of identifying obstacles through `cv2.cvtColor()`. In greyscale, the intensity of each pixel represents different shades of grey, disregarding colour which is not needed to identify black (all obstacles are black as stated in assumptions). Once the image is rendered, *Thresholding* takes place which outputs an image where the black obstacles are distinctly visible against the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar process to above, the contours are detected but for obstacles, they are further simplifed in the process of *Contour Approximation* utilising `cv2.approxPolyDP()` to create the shape of the obstacles. This returns the object (obstacle) defined as a set of corners. This is done in order to balance between retaining the essential shape while reducing computational complexity. This serves to keep the algorithm efficient while maintaining accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the boundaries of the actual obstacles and the robot have been defined. But in order to ensure that the path planning function is able to create a safe path through the obstacles, we conduct a *Vector Calculation* for Obstacles. \n",
    "This is done in `find_farthest_vector()` which takes in the set of corners for each of the obstacles, with the end goal being to create a safety net around obstacles to avoid collision. For each corner, this function calculates the sum of two vectors made from a two vectors [previous_corner, corner] and [next_corner, coner] (in green and blue in the image below) and normalizes it. We then get the vector pointing outward relative to an obstacle for each corner of an obstacle (final vector in red in the image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can set the corners of each obstacles at a certain distance (determined using the scale factor obtained from the `find_robot()` function) along this vector from the obstacle. This helps create a buffer around the obstacles hence preventing the robot's path from getting too close to an obstacle. This also allows for the accomodation of any errors in measurement or movement.\n",

    "### Requirements on the obstacles for local avoidance\n",
    "For local avoidance to work, obstacles must have the following characteristics: \n",
    "- The obstacles must be black:\n",
    "  - because path planning can only be carried out with black obstacles. If the obstacle placed is not black, the robot will detect it and move backwards, but when it recalculates its path, it will not take the new obstacle into account.\n",
    "- Measure more than 5 cm in height:\n",
    "   - otherwise the obstacle cannot be detected by the proximity sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local avoidance implementation\n",
    "Local avoidance is implemented as follows: \n",
    "If, during the program run, while the robot is moving towards its goal (in state 1), the value read by one of the horizontal proximity sensors is greater than a defined constant (THRESHOLD_OBSTACLE), a boolean variable obstacle_detected is set to True. The constant threshold obstacle has been set to 100 empirically. The function that updates this boolean is `get_sensors(node)`. When an obstacle is detected, the robot changes state to state 4.  \n",
    "The following cell contains the function get_sensors(node). This function is the same function that is used to identify whether or not the robot has been kidnapped.\n"

    "Kidnapping is detected in a similar way to local avoidance. When the program is in state 1 (i.e. the robot is heading towards its goal), if the robot is abducted, the two sensors facing the ground determine whether the robot has been kidnapped. The function that handles this is `get_sensors(node)`. The sensors will return a small value, close to zero. If the value returned by the sensors is smaller than a defined threshold (SEUIL_KIDNAPPED), then the kidnapped Boolean variable is set to TRUE. In the state 1, if kidnapped is True, the motors stop turning, and the state is changed to state 3. The cell below shows the portion of code in state 1 changing the state to state 3 if the robot has been kidnapped."
